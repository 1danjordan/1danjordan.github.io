<p>Recently I’ve been delving into the depths of R, while learning Docker and even getting to know Linux much better. The result is Experimental-R, a docker image with an experimental build of R 3.4. Below is Experimental-R’s README, read on for details!</p>
<div id="experimental-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Experimental-R</h1>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dandermotj/experimental-r.git
cd experimental-r
docker build -t experimental-r .
docker run --rm -ti experimental-r</code></pre>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">experimental-r-demo</p>
</div>
<p>Experimental-R contains Dockerfiles for customised R builds. Inspired by the Rocker project, Experimental-R conveniently lets users try out experimental R builds without having to compile R from source themselves.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of <a href="lionel-.github.io">Lionel Henry</a>, the first Experimental-R image takes the recently released R 3.4 and includes one killer feature - a native pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code>. No more dependencies on magrittr’s <code>%&gt;%</code>, or confusing tracebacks when pipelines go wrong.</p>
<div id="why" class="section level2">
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Around one year ago, Lionel wrote a blog post on the called ‘The Future of R Syntax?’. In this post he discusses 4 features he implemented in R source:</p>
<ul>
<li>a native pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code></li>
<li>list brackets <code>[1, &quot;abc&quot;, iris]</code></li>
<li>lambda notation <code>[x] -&gt; x*5</code></li>
<li>labelled blocks <code>testthat(&quot;blocks&quot;) { ... }</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I was intrigued by Lionel’s work and wanted to try it out myself. Thankfully Lionel published his work on <a href="https://github.com/dandermotj/r-source">Github</a>. So all I had to do was build R from source, which is not so trivial, especially when building from a git repo, because R source code is managed in SVN.</p>
<p>I want users to get excited about features that we <em>could</em> have in future R releases. Ultimately my motivation for doing this is to encourage R core to implement these features in R 4.0. R Core’s conservatism has been extremely important in R’s establishment and growth. <em>But</em> these features deserve to be first class R features, not just package features; they’ve proven their usefulness in R and in other languages.</p>
</div>
<div id="going-further" class="section level2">
<h2>Going Further</h2>
<p>I was hoping to merge all of Lionel’s features into one branch and compile a version of R 3.4 with all of them, but unfortunately there were lots of merge conflicts in C files I had no luck resolving. Instead I picked the feature I want the most, the pipe, and maybe in the future with some help we can release an image with the whole lot.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Lionel for his work and to Dirk Eddelbuttel and Carl Boettiger for their work on Rocker, which inspired this small project.</p>
