<p>This is how David Robinson opens his tremendous book <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes">Introduction to Empirical Bayes</a>. This sentiment is the foundation the book builds on; learning through terse academic text is hard, learning through interactive, motivated and visual problems is fun. Robinson’s book moves at a perfect pace, within a familiar context (the R console) using an intuitive example set (baseball). In his own words, the book teaches through “a single case study: that of batting averages in baseball statistics”.</p>
<p>As someone who studied Bayesian statistics in university and struggled with the mathematical intuition, I approached this book on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method">Empirical Bayes</a> with hope that things would “click”. I’ve read David’s blog <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/">Variance Explained</a> for awhile now and I had read the posts (and <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/47771/what-is-the-intuition-behind-beta-distribution">StackOverflow answers</a>) that this book originated from; so I knew David’s approach suited my learning style - motivated, interactive and plenty of graphics.</p>
<p>This book is set in the R console. Each chapter is self contained. The data comes from the <a href="https://github.com/cdalzell/Lahman">Lahman package</a>, transformations are done with tidyr and dplyr and plotting with ggplot2, so if you are an R programmer and a user of the tidyverse then this is a perfect setting to learn interactively.</p>
<p>Being familiar with the Tidyverse makes this <em>such</em> a pleasant experience because I can connect the math to the functions and data structures I know so well. The code below is begins every chapter. It loads baseball data and prepares it for analysis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)

career &lt;- Batting %&gt;% 
  filter(AB &gt; 0) %&gt;% 
  anti_join(Pitching, by = &quot;playerID&quot;) %&gt;% 
  group_by(playerID) %&gt;% 
  summarize(H = sum(H), AB = sum(AB)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(average = H / AB)</code></pre>

<p>With such a clear motivation and David’s measured, step by step explanations, it’s a joy to learn Empirical Bayes method. Presented in Tufte’s style and with beatiful plots like this, this book is a joy to the eye too. Below is a plot of 100 random batters’ Batting Average versus their shrunk Empirical Bayes Batting Average, recreated from the book.</p>
